#A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a personâ€™s age. If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; if
#they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10; and if they are over age 12, the ticket is $15. Write a loop in which you ask users their 
#age, and then tell them the cost of their movie ticket

age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))

for x in range(1):
    if age < 3:
        print("Your ticket is free!")
    elif 3 < age < 12:
        print("Your ticket cost is $10.")
    else:
        print("Your ticket cost is $15.")
